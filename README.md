# NC - NEWS

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About this App

This app was created using a Back-End API that I created using PostgreSQL, Express.JS, Jest, Husky, JS.
This app is a News app that displays different articles from my API with the ability to change users, sort articles, post comments and delete comments.
Although this app doesn't look like the most beautiful app in the world, the React in this app is strong.

During the process of making this app I learned a variety of React skills including:

- `useState`
- `useEffect`
- `useContext`
- `useSearchParams`
- `React Routing`
- `Optimistic Rendering`
- `Composition in React`
